          August 22:
          <br> Slept in and hung out
          <br>Peter swam for two hours and met Connie from England. She tried to teach Peter a handstand in the water. He thought it was tricky.
          <br>
          <br>Peter and Mom read books on the porch while Mama napped.
          <br>
          <br>Then we all went to an archery lesson.
          <br>And Peter got a bullseye!
          <br>And Mama got a novice injury, but she was very tough about it.
          <br>And Mom had a good time doing an old hobby.
          <br>We had dinner at Timberloft Pizzeria, and they had a free jukebox. Peter mostly played Lady Gaga.
          <br>
          <br>We went on a nighttime flashlight hike that went from 8:30 to 10:00! Peter wasn't scared. Peter ate some interesting things on the trail. He ate white fir needles, which tasted citrusy. He then ate TWO carpenter ants! They are also called blueberry ants because they taste sweet. He ate a thimbleberry, which wasn't as sweet as the ant. He finished by brushing his teeth with a leaf from the manzanita plant like the Native Americans used to. On the hike, we also saw many bats. The guide threw a stick in the air to get the bats to chase it using echolocation. Some people on the tour were FREAKED OUT by the bats!
          <br>We were tired after the hike and had a great night's sleep.
          <br>(Sorry about no pictures. They would probably be over the GitHub file size limit, so I would not be able to upload them.)

          <br>Hang out time
          <br> Morning swim for Peter that lasted two hours
          <br> We then drove to Glacier Point and stopped first at Washburn Point. It had a breathtaking view of Half Dome and two waterfalls.
          <br> We drove on to Glacier Point, which had amazing views of Yosemite Valley. When we looked over the edge it was a long way down.
          <br> Mama hiked bravely down to a lookout point.
          <br> We bought several kinds of ice cream bars and enjoyed the view.
          <br> Next, we encountered ...

          <br> It was so smelly, Peter couldn't even get his pee out.
          <br>
          <br>The next adventure was the Sentinel Dome hike.

          <br>But the redeeming part of the hike was a tree right in middle of the path, where its bark looked melted chocolate, but it smelled like vanilla. Several other hikers didn't believe us but were amazed after we convinced them to sniff.
          <br>We had dinner at Jackalope's Bar and Grill again and had delicious onion rings. Mama drew the picture of the hike included above!
